# Pastebin 
The best way to send files, links, and more from one device to another.


## Installation

Install pastebin from the [releases page](https://github.com/Quantalabs/pastebin/releases), and download the latest zip file for your operating system. 

Installation is also avaliable through git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quantalabs/pastebin # or gh repo clone Quantalabs/pastebin
npm install
node . # Starts pastebin
```

If updating to a new release, simply download the executable file for your operating system and replace the old executable with the new one. This will work with minor releases only, do not do this with a major release.
    
## Usage

To create a server, run the following:
```sh
pastebin [PORT] [HOST]
```
The port and host are optional. The port defaults to 8080, and the host defaults to your network ip (so you can access the server from another computer.)
