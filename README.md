# Pastebin

Pastebin is a tool that allows seamless connections between different devices.
It is, simply put, the fastest, most modern, most reliable, and most extensible 21st-century alternative to emailing yourself.

If Pastebin is unable to detect your IP address for local hosting, or you would like it to host on a particular URL each time, you can specify these parameters as the following environment variables:

```sh
export PASTEBIN_HOST='localhost'
export PASTEBIN_PORT='8080'
```

Above are the default values; change them to match your needs.

## Here's how it works:

### Text/URLs

1. Copy text or URLs to clipboard
2. Open up Pastebin and paste them into the text box
3. Click the "Go" button
4. Scan the QR code or open Pastebin on another computer
5. Click the "Copy" button

### Files/Directories

1. Open up Pastebin
2. Drag and drop files or directories into the upload box
3. Click the "Submit" button
4. Scan the QR code or open Pastebin on another computer
5. Do <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to download the file
